### Requirements Coverage

**Phase 5.5 Requirements (from ROADMAP.md):**

| Requirement | Status | Blocking Issue |
|-------------|--------|----------------|
| LITE-01: Public self-service registration | SATISFIED | All supporting artifacts verified |
| LITE-02: QR menu in 5 minutes | SATISFIED | Onboarding flow and QR generation complete |
| LITE-03: Basic menu analytics | SATISFIED | Tracking and dashboard display functional |
| LITE-04: Upgrade path to Pro/Full | SATISFIED | Upgrade page and prompts in place |
| LITE-05: 50+ signups in first month | NEEDS HUMAN | Business metric - cannot verify until launch |

### Anti-Patterns Found

**No blocking anti-patterns detected.**

Minor findings:

| File | Line | Pattern | Severity | Impact |
|------|------|---------|----------|--------|
| apps/web/app/[locale]/lite/upgrade/page.tsx | 19 | TODO comment about payment | Info | Expected - payment processing deferred per design |
| apps/web/app/[locale]/register/page.tsx | 186-270 | placeholder in form inputs | Info | Not stub code - legitimate HTML placeholders |


### Human Verification Required

#### 1. Complete Registration Flow (5-Minute Test)

**Test:** Starting from landing page, register a new account, complete all 4 onboarding steps, and reach the lite dashboard. Time the process.

**Expected:** 
- Flow completes in under 5 minutes
- No confusing steps or errors
- Dashboard loads with menu data from onboarding
- QR code downloads successfully

**Why human:** Timing, UX flow, and overall user experience require human judgment. Automated tests verify components exist and are wired, but cannot assess if the experience is intuitive.

#### 2. QR Code Functionality

**Test:** 
- Download QR code in all 3 sizes (small/medium/large)
- Scan QR code with mobile device
- Verify it opens the public menu page

**Expected:**
- QR codes download as PNG files
- Scanning opens /menu/[slug] page with restaurant menu
- Public menu displays correctly on mobile

**Why human:** Requires physical QR scanning with a mobile device. Automated tests can verify QR generation logic but not actual scanning behavior.

#### 3. Mobile Responsiveness

**Test:** Access landing page, registration, onboarding, and lite dashboard on mobile device (phone and tablet).

**Expected:**
- All pages render correctly on small screens
- Touch interactions work smoothly
- Forms are easy to fill on mobile keyboards
- Navigation is accessible

**Why human:** Visual layout, responsive design, and touch interactions require human testing on actual devices at various screen sizes.

#### 4. Analytics Tracking Accuracy

**Test:**
- Open public menu page multiple times from different sessions
- Check dashboard analytics counts
- Verify MenuView records in database match displayed counts

**Expected:**
- views_today increments correctly
- Unique visitors tracked via session_id
- Source detection works (qr vs link)
- Dashboard displays accurate counts

**Why human:** Requires verifying database state and comparing with displayed analytics. While API is wired, accuracy of aggregation logic needs validation.

#### 5. Upgrade Prompts and Tier Differentiation

**Test:**
- Log in as Free tier user
- Verify RESTO360 branding visible on menu
- Check upgrade prompts appear in dashboard
- Visit upgrade page and review tier comparison

**Expected:**
- Free tier shows RESTO360 branding
- Upgrade prompts visible but not intrusive
- Tier comparison clearly explains benefits
- Pro tier features are gated appropriately

**Why human:** Visual positioning, messaging clarity, and brand presentation require human judgment. Automated tests verify components exist but not their effectiveness.

#### 6. Lite Menu Editor CRUD Operations

**Test:**
- Create new category
- Add menu items to category
- Edit item name, price, description
- Toggle item availability
- Delete item and category

**Expected:**
- All operations complete without errors
- UI updates immediately after changes
- Changes persist after page refresh
- Validation prevents invalid data

**Why human:** While API calls are verified, end-to-end CRUD flow with UI feedback, validation behavior, and data persistence needs human testing.


### Summary

**All automated verifications passed.** The phase goal is technically achieved:

**Truth 1 (Public self-service):** Registration API creates restaurant with plan_type=free, registration form POSTs to API and redirects to onboarding, no manual intervention required.

**Truth 2 (QR menu in 5 minutes):** 4-step onboarding wizard guides user through details, category, menu item, and QR download. QR codes generate in 3 sizes with menu URL.

**Truth 3 (Menu analytics):** Public menu tracks views via TrackMenuViewAPI, MenuView model stores events, dashboard fetches analytics via AnalyticsSummaryAPI and displays views_today/week/month.

**Truth 4 (Upgrade path):** Upgrade page shows Free vs Pro vs Full comparison, captures upgrade interest (payment processing deferred per design), UpgradePrompt components placed in dashboard.

**Human verification recommended before considering phase complete:**
- 5-minute registration timing
- QR code scanning functionality
- Mobile responsiveness
- Analytics accuracy
- Upgrade flow UX

**No gaps requiring code changes identified.** All must-have artifacts exist, are substantive (adequate length, no stubs), and are wired (components call APIs, APIs query database, state renders in UI).
