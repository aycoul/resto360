# Phase 5.5: RESTO360 Lite - Context

## User Decisions (LOCKED)

These decisions were made during brainstorming and design. Plans MUST implement these exactly.

### Tier Structure
- **Free tier**: Unlimited, basic menu, RESTO360 branding
- **Pro tier**: $10/month, custom branding, priority support
- **Full Platform**: Custom pricing, includes POS, payments, delivery

### Plan Field on Restaurant Model
```python
plan_type = models.CharField(choices=[
    ('free', 'Free'),
    ('pro', 'Pro'),
    ('full', 'Full Platform'),
], default='free')
```

### Public Registration Flow
1. Landing page → Register button
2. Registration form (email, password, restaurant name, phone)
3. Auto-create restaurant with `plan_type='free'`
4. Redirect to onboarding wizard

### Onboarding Wizard (4 Steps)
1. Restaurant details (name, address, phone, logo)
2. First category creation
3. First menu item creation (with photo)
4. QR code generation and download

### Lite Dashboard Features
- Overview: Menu views (today/week/month), visitor count, QR scans
- Menu editor: Standalone version (not POS-integrated)
- QR codes: Multiple sizes, download options
- Upgrade prompts: Strategic placement

### Landing Page Structure
- Hero: "Your menu, online in 5 minutes"
- Social proof: Restaurant count, view count
- Features: 3-column grid
- Pricing: Free vs Pro comparison
- CTA: "Get Started Free"

### Color Scheme (FindMenu-inspired)
- Primary: Emerald/teal gradient
- Accents: Green for CTAs, actions
- Consistent with existing QR menu design

### Analytics Models
```python
class MenuView(TenantModel):
    viewed_at = models.DateTimeField()
    session_id = models.CharField()  # Anonymous tracking
    source = models.CharField()  # qr, link, whatsapp

class DailyMenuStats(TenantModel):
    date = models.DateField()
    total_views = models.IntegerField()
    unique_visitors = models.IntegerField()
    top_items = models.JSONField()  # [{item_id, views}]
```

### What Lite Does NOT Include
- POS interface
- Kitchen display
- Inventory management
- Payment processing
- Delivery management
- WhatsApp ordering

These remain gated to Full tier via plan_type checks.

## Claude's Discretion

Implementation choices Claude can make:

### API Design
- Endpoint structure for public registration
- Serializer patterns for menu analytics
- Caching strategy for menu view counts

### Frontend Components
- Component organization within `/app/[locale]/`
- Animation choices for onboarding
- Chart library for analytics (if needed)

### Database Migrations
- Migration ordering
- Index strategies for analytics queries

### Testing Approach
- Test file organization
- Mock strategies for analytics

## Deferred Ideas (NOT in this phase)

- Subscription payment processing (future enhancement)
- Email marketing integration
- A/B testing for landing page
- Referral program
- Mobile app for Lite users
- Advanced analytics (funnels, cohorts)
