## Files Created/Modified

### Created
- `apps/web/app/[locale]/lite/layout.tsx` - Protected layout with LiteContext provider
- `apps/web/app/[locale]/lite/dashboard/page.tsx` - Overview with stats and quick actions
- `apps/web/app/[locale]/lite/menu/page.tsx` - Menu editor page with API integration
- `apps/web/app/[locale]/lite/qr/page.tsx` - QR code generation and download
- `apps/web/components/lite/LiteSidebar.tsx` - Navigation with upgrade CTA
- `apps/web/components/lite/LiteHeader.tsx` - Header with plan badge and user dropdown
- `apps/web/components/lite/MenuEditor.tsx` - Main editor with category/item modals
- `apps/web/components/lite/CategoryCard.tsx` - Category with edit/delete actions
- `apps/web/components/lite/MenuItemCard.tsx` - Item with availability toggle
- `apps/web/components/lite/UpgradePrompt.tsx` - Reusable upgrade CTA component

### Modified
- `apps/web/messages/fr.json` - Added lite.dashboard, lite.qr, lite.menu, lite.upgrade namespaces
- `apps/web/messages/en.json` - Added lite.dashboard, lite.qr, lite.menu, lite.upgrade namespaces
- `apps/web/package.json` - Added qrcode and @types/qrcode dependencies

## Decisions Made

- **LiteContext for shared state:** Layout provides restaurant and user data to all child routes via context
- **Client-side QR generation:** Using qrcode library for instant download without server round-trip
- **Three upgrade prompt variants:** Banner (dismissible), card (with features list), inline (simple text link)
- **Stats as placeholders:** Dashboard shows "-" values - will be wired to analytics API in Plan 05

## Deviations from Plan

None - plan executed exactly as written.

## Issues Encountered

None.

## User Setup Required

None - no external service configuration required.

## Next Phase Readiness

- Lite dashboard routes fully functional at /lite/dashboard, /lite/menu, /lite/qr
- Menu editor ready for real data (API endpoints exist from Phase 2)
- QR codes generate correctly with restaurant slug in URL
- Stats placeholders ready to be wired to analytics API (Plan 05)
- Upgrade prompts strategically placed for free tier conversion
